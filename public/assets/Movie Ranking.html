<h3>My top 3 movies from 2021-2025</h3>

  <h4><li>My fault</li></h4>  
    I was sucked into the world of Noah and Nicholas in the first 10 minutes of watching this film.I read the books ater I watched the movies just to try to find out what might happen next.I highly,highly recommend!

  <h4><li>Duplicity</li></h4>
  This movie was mind boggling.I absolutely love watching crime movies/shows and when I saw Kat Graham(BonBon) from the Vampire Diaries I knew it would be a good movie.They had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
   <h4><li>Wish Dragon</li></h4> 
   One of the joys of my relationship is that my husband also loves to watch annimations.He recommended we watch this movie and I had a blast.It was so heartwarming and genuine to see the Long and Din find their true purpose and become the best of friends.Long went from the high and Mighty Dragon to Din's best friend who gave up his freedom to give Din his last wish.He then knew what friendship felt like and would rather serve another 10 Masters than let Din suffer.
